# Datascript getting started

DataScript follows the Datomic api very closely, so the Datomic documentation is a good resource: http://docs.datomic.com/clojure/#datomic.api/touch

There is also a lot of good [getting started guide](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/wiki/Getting-started)

@tonsky and the community will appreciate if you ask API/usage questions on the [#datascript gitter channel](https://gitter.im/tonsky/datascript). GitHub [issues](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/issues) should be reserved for "real" issues (bugs/problems and such):

## Clojure quick start

```
[:require  ...
```

## Javascript quick start

```js
import {datascript as d} from 'datascript';

```
